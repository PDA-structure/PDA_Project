"""
PDA Analysis Software - Revit Analytical Model Exporter

Exports the Revit analytical model (beams, columns, braces) to PDA's canonical
JSON interchange format (schema_version 1.0, solver "frame2d").

Usage: Run this script from a pyRevit button/script in Revit 2023+.

Requirements:
  - Revit 2023 or later (uses the AnalyticalMember API, not the removed
    element.GetAnalyticalModel() call from pre-2023 Revit).
  - pyRevit 4.8+ (for CPython support) or pyRevit with IronPython 2.7.4+.

Notes:
  - Revit internal coordinates are ALWAYS in feet, regardless of the project's
    display units. This script converts to metres (* 0.3048).
  - The exported JSON contains geometry only (nodes, members, default E/I/A).
    Supports, loads, and member property overrides must be added in the PDA
    browser UI or edited into the JSON file before solving.
  - Non-planar 3D models: only X and Y coordinates are exported; Z is ignored.
    Verify your model is approximately planar before using with the 2D frame
    solver.
  - IronPython 2.7 compatibility: do NOT use f-strings or other Python 3.6+
    syntax. Use str.format() throughout.
